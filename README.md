# Home Assistant Components

I have a few home assistant components that I've built/adapted which you are welcome to use

## Gecko

This is based on https://github.com/gazoodle/gecko-home-assistant by @gazoodle, optimised for the inYT plateform spas


## Heatmiser Netmonitor

Integration with Heatmier Netmonitor systems. This integration offers thermostat and hot water control. It also has two services;

1. Hot water boost - this will boost the hot water for the specified time
2. Set time - this will set the system time to the current time. Note, you must call this for one entity, but it will update the whole system when you do
